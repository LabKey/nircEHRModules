Cerebral Spinal Fluid Collection from cistem magnum		Procedure							The patient was placed in lateral recumbancy. The skin from the occipital protuberance to the level of C3 was clipped, cleaned, and aseptically draped,. The neck was flexed 90 to 100 degrees at the cisternal region. Care was taken to keep the head parallel to the table. The wings of the atlas were palpated to ensure superimposition. Collection was done (puncture may be made in the center of the triangle formed by the wings of the atlas and the occiput. Alternatively, a midline puncture, halfway between the occiput and the cranial end of the spinous process of C2). The needle was inserted at 90 degrees, and gradually advanced through the various tissue layers. Dura penetration was confirmed by observation of CSF in the hub of the needle. Samples (volume and type) were collected and the needle was gently withdrawn.	true
Cerebral Spinal Fluid Collection from the lumbar region		Procedure							The patient was placed in lateral recumbency. The area was clipped, cleaned, prepared, and aseptically draped. The lumbar spine was gently flexed to open the interarcuate space between L4 and L5. The spinous process caudal to this space was palpated, and the needle inserted at the caudal lateral edge of the spinous process.  The needle was gently advanced until the vertebral arch was encountered, then walked cranially to the interarcuate space. The needle was advanced through the ligament and spinal canal and (sample volume) was collected. The needle was retracted following fluid collection.	true

Complete Therapeutic Caudectomy		Procedure							A tourniquet was placed proximal to the transaction site but not tightened.The skin is clipped and cleaned, and the desired intravertebral transection site identified. A local block is placed proximal to the site. The skin was prepared with PVI, and aseptically draped. The tourniquet was tightened by the anesthetist. A  double V incision was made on the skin distal to the site. The V was oriented to create dorsal and ventral skin flaps that are longer than the desired tail length. The medial and lateral caudal arteries and veins just proximal to the incision site were identified and ligated. The soft tissue just distal to the intervertebral space was incised and the distal tail disarticulate. Bleeding was controlled with direct pressure (or circumferential ligature around the distal end of the remaining tail or re-ligate the caudal vessels). Subcutaneous tissue and muscle were apposed over the exposed vertebrae with interrupted approximating sutures of ______. The skin edges were apposed with _________.	true

Enucleation		Procedure							The skin clipped, cleaned, aseptically prepared, and sterilely draped. An incision was made 1-2 cm laterally from the junction of the upper and lower eyelid margins. Using thumb forceps, the conjunctiva was grasped near the limbus. A 360 degree perilimbal incision was made. Using curved Metzenbaum’s, s the conjunctiva, Tenon’s capsule, and extraocular muscle were separated from the sclera. The lacrimal gland was excised. Once the globe attachments were freed, the globe was gently retracted. The optic nerve was served with curved Metzendaum scissors. Hemorrhage was controlled with gentle pressure. Approximagely 3-4 mm of the eyelid margins were removed, to the medial canthus. The angularis oculi vein located superficial and medial to the medial canthal tendon was avoided. The conjunctiva, orbital septum and Tenon’s capsule were closed with 3-0 ________. The subcutaneous tissue was apposed with 4-0 _______. The lid margins were closed with _______.	true

Partial Therapeutic Caudectomy		Procedure							The distal tail is wrapped with gauze and tape and the skin is aseptically prepared. A tourniquet is placed proximal to the transaction site. Determine the desired intravertebral transaction site and ake a double V incision in the skin distal to the site. The V is oriented to create dorsal and ventral skin flaps that are longer than the desired tail length. Identify and ligate the medial and lateral caudal arteries and veins just proximal to the incision site. Incise the soft tissue just distal to the intervertebral space and disarticulate the distal tail. If bleeding occurs, place a circumferential ligature around the distal end of the remaining tail or re-ligate the caudal vessels. Appose subcutaneous tissue and muscle over the exposed vertebrae with interrupted approximating sutures. Appose the skin edges with approximating sutures.	true
